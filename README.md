# Bankist
A simple yet elegant banking application with minimalistic aesthetics and a huge set of functional and useful features.

My First fully functional web application, developed Using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript, during my early learning phase.

With this project I strengthened my grasp on Arrays and associated Methods, Timer Functions, HTML Structuring, Modern CSS Styling, Intl.js (Internationalization) Library as well as Call back Functions.
I also learnt a many good coding practices for maintaining Code Quality in the form of Readablitiy, Modularity as well as Proper Scope Handling.
