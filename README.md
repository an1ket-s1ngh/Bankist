# Bankist
A simple yet elegant banking application with minimalistic aesthetics and a huge set of functional and useful features.

My First fully functional web application, developed Using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript, during my early learning phase.
With this project I strengthened my grasp on Arrays and associated Methods, Timers Functions, HTML Structure, CSS commands, Intl.js (Internationalization) Library.
I also learnt a few good coding practices for maintaining Code Quality in the form of Readablitiy, Modularity as well as Proper Scope Handling.
